- When I try to run the UniTest located in "ElectionTest.java", I keep getting
  the same message, after copiling:

  ElectionTest.java:1: error: package org.junit.jupiter.api does not exist
  import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*; 

  I did build the path and everything but I can't figure out how to fix it.
  And because of that I couldn't test my code.
